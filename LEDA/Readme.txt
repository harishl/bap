User Manual.

File Install/src.txt describes how to compile the LEDA libraries in 
the source code package for Unix and Microsoft Windows.

LEDA Libraries and Packages 
---------------------------

The implementations of most LEDA data types and algorithms are 
precompiled in libraries.

For Microsoft Windows we offer two libraries (leda and libGeoW).
The code for unix platforms is contained in one library libleda
that can be linked with C++ application programs.
