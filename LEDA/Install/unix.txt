Remark: This file describes the situation in a LEDA package. 



1. Files and Directories
------------------------

To compile and link your programs with LEDA, the LEDA main directory 
should contain at least the following files and subdirectories: 

Readme.txt                  Readme File 
Install/unix.txt            this file 
incl/                       the LEDA include directory 
libleda.a (libleda.so)      basic library 

The static library has extension .a. If a shared library is provided 
it has extension .so. 


2. Preparations
---------------

Unpacking the LEDA distribution file 
LEDA-<ver>-<sys>-<cc>.tar.gz will create the LEDA root 
directory "LEDA-<ver>-<sys>-<cc>". You might want to rename 
it or move it to some different place. Let <LEDA> denote the final 
complete path name of the LEDA root directory. 

To install and use the Unix object code of LEDA you have to modify 
your environment as follows: 

a)  LEDAROOT:
Set the environment variable LEDAROOT to the LEDA root directory: 

csh/tcsh: setenv LEDAROOT <LEDA> 
    
sh/bash: LEDAROOT=<LEDA> 
  export LEDAROOT 

b)  Command Search Path:
Include $LEDAROOT/Manual/cmd into your command search path 
(environment variable path (csh) or PATH (sh)) and call rehash (if 
required by your system). 

c)  Shared Library: (for solaris, linux, irix, osf1) 
If you planning to use shared libraries include $LEDAROOT into the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH search path. Then go to $LEDAROOT and type 
make shared. This will construct the shared libraries from the static
libraries. 
Please note: Building the shared library is not supported on each
platform.

d)  xlman and demos: Go to $LEDAROOT and type make xlman to compile 
and link LEDA's interactive manual reader xlman. Now you can start 
xlman for reading and printing manual pages, starting demo programs 
and browsing more release notes. 
      

3. Compiling and linking application programs
---------------------------------------------

a) Use the -I compiler flag to tell the compiler where to find the 
LEDA header files.

CC (g++) -I$LEDAROOT/incl -c file.c

b) Use the -L compiler flag to tell the compiler where to find the 
library (libleda.a/so)

CC (g++)  -L$LEDAROOT file.o -lleda -lX11 -lm

If using windows on solaris systems you might have to link 
with the system socket library and the network services library as 
well:
CC (g++)  ... -lleda -lX11 -lsocket -lnsl -lm

c) Compile and link simultaneously with

CC (g++)  -I$LEDAROOT/incl -L$LEDAROOT file.c -lleda -lX11 -lm

You may want to ask your system adminstrator to install the header 
files and library in the system's default directories.
Then you no longer have to specify header and library search paths on 
the compiler command line.


4. Example programs and demos
-----------------------------

The source code of all example and demo programs can be found in 
$LEDAROOT/test and $LEDAROOT/demo. Goto $LEDAROOT/test or 
$LEDAROOT/demo and type "make" to compile and link all test or  demo 
programs, respectively.
